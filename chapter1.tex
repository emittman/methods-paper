\section{Introduction}
Because there are many genes to observe, a gene expression experiment presents an opportunity to learn the underlying distribution of the gene-specific parameters. Choosing to model this underlying distribution with a parametric family that is too restrictive, i.e. leads to too crude an approximation of the underlying process, means that very little borrowing of information across genes.

We also want to estimate functionals of the parameters by integrating over the entire posterior.

\section{Voom}
We'd like to know whether it makes a difference whether we use voom precision weights. It might be good to compare results with and without the weights for the non-parametric method vs a standard method, like vanilla limma.
